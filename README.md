# Recursive-Reasoning

In this project, I have reimplemented the Maieutic Reasoning Paper(see citation at the end) using Google's FLAN-T5-XL and XXL. Maieutic Reasoning means generating explanations through repeated questioning to finally reach a decision. Reaching the decision is a satisfiability problem. We use RC2 MAXSAT in this to find out the satisfiability for the decisions and reach a binary decision of whether true or false. 

## Example generated by FLAN-T5-XL for the proposition = (If Becky is allergic to legumes, while Nancy is allergic to tree nuts, Nancy is more likely to eat peanuts than Becky.)
```
If Becky is allergic to legumes, while Nancy is allergic to tree nuts, Nancy is more likely to eat peanuts than Becky.
├── If one is allergic to tree nuts, one would not eat peanuts.
│   └── Peanuts and tree nuts are different types of tree Nut.
├── In fact, if Nancy is allergic to tree nuts she would only eat peanuts.
│   └── Tree nuts and peanuts are very different nut.
└── Nancy are allergic to tree nuts and Becky is not.
    ├── Nancy can't eat any kind of nut while Becky can be allergic.
    └── Tree nuts are common among the population and one only has to look online in order to see if they are allergic to certain foods.
```

For generating trees run the following code : 

```
 > python3 main_gen2.py --dataset_name com2sense --mode normal --seed 21
```

For inference on the generated trees : 

```
  > python3 main_inference2.py --dataset_name com2sense --mode normal --seed 21
```
